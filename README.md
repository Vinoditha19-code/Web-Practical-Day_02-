01. Basic Arrays and Loops:

The script initializes three arrays (num, name, num) and iterates through them using a for loop.
The console.log statements help visualize the array contents.

02. ForEach Loop:

The forEach() method loops through each element of the num array and executes the function provided, printing each number.

03.The forEach() loop is used to compare each element with max and update it whenever a larger number is found.

04. forEach() can be used to iterate through nested arrays, printing each sub-array.

05. Reversing an Array using Push and Pop:

Uses a new array (a1) to reverse another array by popping elements and pushing them into the new array. 

06.Finding Common Elements Between Two Arrays
  The nested loop checks each element in array a against each element in array b to find matches.When a common element is found, it is printed.

07. Push and Pop Operations
push() adds a new element to the end of the array
pop() removes the last element from the array.

07. JSON 
Creates a student object and an array of students, displaying them in JSON format, demonstrating object handling in JavaScript.
